Piano Sonata Op.111 (L.Beethoven)
---------------------------------

A transcription of Beethoven's 32nd piano sonata (Op.111) in Lilypond format.

Feel free to open an issue if you have suggestions for improvements.

**Todo: add fingering, and the third variation needs one last check.**

Notes
-----

u = upper staff; l = lower staff; M = measure(s)

For this transcription, two manuscripts were consulted: the [original holograph manuscript](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/396221) from January 1822, and the [fair copy](http://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/12722) made later that year for the Schlesinger edition.

**1st movement**

* 64 u: No ***sf*** is present in the manuscript, but the analogous passage in M 142 does have one. For consistency, a parenthesized ***sf*** was added.
* 84 u/l: Beethoven's manuscript crosses the right hand over into the bottom staff. We kept them separate.
* 133 u: No ***ff***; parenthesized as per M 55.

**2nd movement**

* 1 l: Fingering only applies to the repetition.
* 30 u: The manuscripts appear to be in conflict; the original ends the slur on the first *b/e*, and the Schlesinger version ends it on the *b* just after. Here we utilize the latter.
* 39 l: The first of many implicit tuplets to follow.
* 117 u: The first of the two tied notes actually has a duration of a dotted 32nd note—otherwise the bar duration does not add up. As per the manuscript, it's written as a 64th note.
